         <p style="font-size: 30px;">Shri Ram's temple will be ready in Ayodhya on 22 January 2024 and everyone will be able to go there to have darshan of God. There has been a dispute on this issue in Ram temple for 500 years. This dispute of Ram Mandir continued for 500 years and why was it not resolved even after so many years of Independence and how Ram Mandir became a political agenda. This whole dispute started in the year 1528 when Babar's army general Mir Baqi demolished the ancient Ram temple situated in Ayodhya and built a mosque which later came to be known as Babri Masjid. The bricks and pillars of the temple were broken. According to some Hindu texts, it was reused in the construction of the mosque itself. The ancient Ram temple which was demolished by Mir Baqi was built by a Hindu king Vikram Aditya. After the year 1528, this entire place became disputed. Babar wrote his autobiography. Whose name was Babar Nama in 1598, where he has mentioned this incident of demolishing the temple and building a mosque. Apart from this, this thing is also mentioned in many European texts. Some records also believe that the mosque was built by Aurangzeb and not Babar. Many historians have given different explanations regarding this confusion between Aurangzeb and Babar. Well, for a long time, Hindus have been demanding their rights at this place, due to which there is a lot of discord between the Hindu and Muslim communities. Disputes have also been going on and out of this, there is mention of one dispute which aroused great anger among the Dono community in the year 1855, after which a small part of this place was taken away by the Hindu community. Later, there was a lot of change in the political structure of entire India. Major change takes place. We are talking about the First Independence War in the year 1856-57, the result of which was that along with Chhas and Gwalior, Ayodhya city also came under the rule of the British East India Company, after which the Ayodhya dispute was settled. Seeing the possibility of Cumulus in the future, the British try to resolve the dispute of Ram Janmabhoomi and they find a solution in such a way that people of both the communities can practice their religious rituals in the disputed area of Ayodhya.</p>

Mahant Raghuvir Das ji files the first suit in Faizabad District Magistrate and the second suit in Faizabad District Court. He demands permission to build the temple in front of Ram Chabutra. But their appeal was rejected at both the places, the result of which was that the Hindu community used to worship the idol of Lord Ram under the Ram platform located outside the mosque till independence.

            <p style="font-size: 30px; ">But KK Nair did not obey the PM's order at that time and refused to move those statues from there. After his reply, Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Panth pressures him to remove the statues but KK Nair does not follow his orders either. And he advises to resolve this issue in the court, so now if the orders are not followed, the idols are covered with net and the locals start worshiping Lord Ram there but after a few days, the government declares that area as disputed. She declares it and locks the entrance there. It is said that if KK Nair had followed PM Nehan's order that day, the Ram Temple dispute would never have been resolved and he would have had to bear the brunt of not following the PM's order. Had to suffer, he had to lose his job and was given an early retirement in 1950

Strangely, she says that when there is no demand of any party to split the land, then how is the decision to split the land being passed?

         <p style="font-size: 30px;">The ancient temple style in which the temple is being built is called Nagar style. The world famous Khaju Rao temple in Madhya Pradesh has also been built in Nagara style. Apart from this, the Koner Surya temple has also been built in the same style. Construction of the temple Makrana marble and pink sandstone of Rajasthan have been used. Along with granite stones of Tamil Nadu and Telangana, colored marbles of Madhya Pradesh have also been used. The Ram temple, built for about Rs 900 crore, will accommodate more than 25,000 people. There will be locker facilities and basic medical services will also be available. A special stone will also be used in this temple which will be brought from Anjani Hill. This hill is located in Karnataka and this place is the birth place of Lord Hanuman. Also some bricks are used in this temple. Will also be used and the big specialty of those bricks is that Shri Ram is written on those bricks, just like the name of Shri Ram was written on the stones while building Ram Setu and some of these bricks are more than 30 years old because These were brought when people started making preparations to build the temple of Lord Shri Ram, but due to no decision being taken for 30 years, these bricks were waiting to be used now. These bricks were brought from all over the country in 1989. It was brought to my attention that steel is not being used in the construction of the temple because the designers and architects who built this temple say that steel gets spoiled after 80 to 100 years but we are trying to make the temple like this. We want it to last for thousands of years. This temple has been designed in such a way that about 70,000 people can visit this temple every day. Two 60 million year old Shaligram rocks, one of 14 tons and one of 26 tons, Nepal. Statues will be made using these two rocks which were given by the Government of India. It is going to be inaugurated on 22 January 2024.

         <p style="font-size: 30px;">Now some people argue that in these Rs 900 crores, many schools and colleges will be built. Another hospital could have been built and Rs 900 crore could have been invested in a temple. Now look, religious tourism has the biggest contribution in India's tourism economy and the biggest chunk of religious tourism also comes from Hindu temples. National Sample. According to a survey report, India's temple economy is worth about Rs 3.2 lakh crore, which is 2.32% of India's GDP. Religious tourism is a huge source of revenue in India and it is also an employment source for many people. This is because a lot of work force is required to meet the demand of products used in religious rituals, which provides employment to many people. After the construction of Ram Temple, many expressways and airport like facilities are increasing in Ayodhya also. After the construction of the temple, a huge price rise has been seen in the real estate sector as well. Now after the inauguration of the Ram temple, lakhs of devotees will come to visit, which will bring a boost to the religious economic activities as well as the hotel, restaurants and transportation sector. There will be a huge boom and lakhs of people will also get employment.

        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Ram Janmabhoomi Movement</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">The Ram Janmabhoomi Movement emerged in the 1980s, led by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, aiming to reclaim the site in Ayodhya where Lord Rama is believed to be born. The disputed site housed the Babri Masjid, constructed by the Mughals.</p>
        <ol style="font-size: 30px;" type="I">
        
            <li>Demolition (1992): A rally turned hostile in 1992, leading to the demolition of the Babri Masjid by volunteers (Kar Sevaks).</li>
            <li>Court's Verdict (2019): The Supreme Court ruled that a Hindu temple existed on the site before the mosque. The disputed land was given to a trust, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, formed by the Indian government for the construction of the Ram Mandir.</li>
            <li>Ayodhya Dispute Legal Journey: The dispute, beginning in 2002, revolved around the control of the site. The Allahabad High Court's 2010 ruling divided the land among the Sunni Board, Nirmohi Akhada, and the Hindu party, with the main disputed section awarded to the Hindus. The 2019 Supreme Court verdict suspended this ruling, allocating the land for a Hindu temple and providing an alternative site for a mosque, based on archaeological findings. The court directed the government to oversee temple construction through a trust.</li>

        <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Rise of Spiritual Tourism in Ayodhya</h2>
        <ol style="font-size: 30px;" type="I">
        
            <li>Ayodhya has seen a rise in spiritual tourism since the announcement of the temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site. In 2022, the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department recorded 2.36 crore domestic and 1,465 foreign tourists in the Ayodhya district, marking an 8,342.7% yearly tourism increase.</li>
            <li>The construction of the Ram Temple has helped the economic condition in Ayodhya.

Ayodhya is a pilgrim town and is a good place to buy religious souvenirs like idols of Lord Ram, Sita, and Lakshman, and t-shirts with religious text.</li>
